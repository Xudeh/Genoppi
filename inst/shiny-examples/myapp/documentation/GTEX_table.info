<b>Genotype tissue expression (GTEx)</b> <br><i>description</i>: A table containing classification of all human protein-coding genes based on transcript expression levels in 53 tissues (20,025 unique genes). Constructed from a gene by tissue matrix containing t-statistics from Finucane et al (see reference and source).  Genes are ranked by the t-statistic, and the top 10% of genes in a tissue are considered 'elevated'. <br><i>format</i>: data.frame object with: tissue, gene, significant (indicating whether the gene is elvated in the tissue.) <br><i>references</i>: Finucane, H.K., Reshef, Y.A., Anttila, V. et al. Heritability enrichment of specifically expressed genes identifies disease-relevant tissues and cell types. Nat Genet 50, 621â€“629 (2018).
